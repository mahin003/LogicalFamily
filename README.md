# LogicalFamily
imagine a scenario , you meet a random person and then think he/she may be somehow related to your family and you somehow are right , but you are not sure what she/he is to you . This java app helps you there, it tells you you relationship with that person cousin/uncle/ant/nephiew whatever .
A simple and silly problem solved in a distubing way . it gave me nightmares . i solved it with the help of Hashmaps (I dindt know algorithm back then) . 

User enters their family tree , first child name then parents name.. for every child of the family/clan . 
then for query user enters two names to find the relatioinship between them .
